# Description

It's almost that time of the year and Santa needs to prepare himself for the busiest of nights. Of course he can't do it alone so he has to comunicate with his elfs and that's where you come in!

# Message
We have intercepted this messages from one of Santa's elfs, Evilio.
We suspect there is something hidden in it.
